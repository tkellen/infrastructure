p After two <a href="http://journal.goingslowly.com/2009/11/no">challenging</a>, <a href="http://journal.goingslowly.com/2009/12/road-to-tozeur">adventure-filled</a> months in <a href="http://journal.goingslowly.com/topic/tunisia">Tunisia</a>, we returned to the <a href="">romance</a> and <a href="http://journal.goingslowly.com/2010/01/rags-to-riches">relative luxury</a> of <a href="http://journal.goingslowly.com/topic/italy">Italy</a>.  Reveling once more in its <a href="http://journal.goingslowly.com/2010/01/pigging-out-in-palermo">delicious food</a> and gorgeous <a href="http://journal.goingslowly.com/2010/01/matera-sassi">old towns</a>, we climbed across the <a href="http://journal.goingslowly.com/2010/01/brrrrrrr">cold</a>, central <a href="http://journal.goingslowly.com/2010/01/climbing-in-cold">Apennine mountain range</a> to board a <a href="http://journal.goingslowly.com/2010/02/blog-post">ferry</a> bound for sunny <a href="http://journal.goingslowly.com/topic/greece">Greece</a>.

p Both on the <a href="http://journal.goingslowly.com/2010/02/exploring-acrocorinth">mainland</a> and on the <a href="http://journal.goingslowly.com/2010/02/climbing-in-crete">island</a> of <a href="http://journal.goingslowly.com/2010/02/celebrating-sunday">Crete</a>, we <a href="http://journal.goingslowly.com/2010/03/snoozin-cruisin">dallied around</a>, enjoying the <a href="http://journal.goingslowly.com/2010/02/what-matters">last of winter</a> in a comparatively <a href="http://journal.goingslowly.com/2010/02/little-things">warm Mediterranean climate</a>.  When <a href="http://journal.goingslowly.com/2010/03/nature-hike-to-meteora">spring</a> made enough of an appearance to embark comfortably on our tour of Eastern Europe, we set off <a href="http://journal.goingslowly.com/2010/03/out-n-about">northwards</a>, into <a href="http://journal.goingslowly.com/2010/03/filling-in-blanks">unknown territory</a>, feeling <a href="http://journal.goingslowly.com/2010/03/hello-macedonia">excited</a> and <a href="http://journal.goingslowly.com/2010/04/into-romania">slightly nervous</a>.

p It wasn't long before we realized that <a href="http://journal.goingslowly.com/2010/04/serbian-hospitality">we loved Eastern Europe</a> and its <a href="http://journal.goingslowly.com/2010/03/springtime-in-macedonia">quiet, agrarian countryside</a>.  Tiny, picturesque <a href="http://journal.goingslowly.com/topic/macedonia">Macedonia</a> stole our hearts and helped us learn Cyrillic, while <a href="http://journal.goingslowly.com/topic/serbia">Serbia</a> served up incredible <a href="http://journal.goingslowly.com/2010/04/serbian-hospitality">hospitality</a>, <a href="http://journal.goingslowly.com/2010/04/homesick">time</a> and <a href="http://journal.goingslowly.com/2010/04/rainy-riverside-ride">time</a> again.

p Finally, we entered <a href="http://journal.goingslowly.com/topic/romania">Romania</a>, feeling as though we'd <a href="http://journal.goingslowly.com/2010/04/to-danube">stepped back in time</a> about two-hundred years.  We fell head over heels for the country's <a href="http://journal.goingslowly.com/2010/04/typical">friendly stray dogs</a>, remote <a href="">mountains</a>, gypsy <a href="http://journal.goingslowly.com/2010/05/draculas-gypsies">wagons</a>, hidden <a href="http://journal.goingslowly.com/2010/04/cave-hunting">caves</a>, fairytale <a href="http://journal.goingslowly.com/2010/04/chance-encounter">forests</a>, <a href="http://journal.goingslowly.com/2010/05/sheep">vampire legends</a>, and many a <a href="http://journal.goingslowly.com/2010/04/universe-provides">kind-hearted soul</a>.
