      <p class="dropcap">As you've probably gathered by now, I have a thing about the past. And by 'thing,' I mean that I, on occasion, become awash in a bone-deep ache for an earlier time. I yearn to experience life in a Tudor village, or travel Canterbury Tales-style from tavern to tavern. Even though I'm fortunate enough to live on ten acres of woodland, I would give a lot to be able to experience its wildness without the drone of planes flying overhead or the buzz of vehicles from two local highways.</p>

      <p>(Granted, I am not so naive as to think it would be idyllic. The all-consuming grind of cooking, laundry, and cleaning would probably drive me insane within the space of day, and I'd surely be burned as a witch within the space of a month. But still. Just as Tyler longs to explore space, I long to explore time.)</p>

      <p>And yet, despite my nostalgia, I also have the opposite thought on a regular basis: <em>I am so thankful I live in this time.</em> My gratitude is for many things (a modicum&mdash;but not much more&mdash;of social equality, washing machines, jeans, etc.) but the one I keep coming back to is this: <strong>I have access to a dazzling array of affordable foods and spices from around the globe</strong>. I can easily buy vanilla beans from Madagascar, whole nutmegs from Indonesia, and hundreds of cardamom pods from India. Even if I can't find kaffir lime leaves at my local general store, I can order them online and they'll arrive at my door within a couple of days. Crazy!</p>

      <p>Crazier still is how recent this proliferation of global food availability has occurred. I mean, my <em>mom</em> can remember when she was a little girl and <em>zucchini</em> first appeared her small-town supermarket! Even more mind-boggling is the realization that surely this global spice trade cannot last forever. I have a hunch that sooner or later, we'll recognize that it isn't sustainable to use fossil fuels to ship food across the globe. Eventually, spices will once again become highly sought-after luxury items like they were for centuries.</p>

      <p>Spices were synonymous with wealth in many cultures and many eras, from Pharoah Hatshepsut to Emperor Chen-Nong to King Henry the Eighth. They were so coveted that they were the cause of shady deals and bloodshed and centuries of oppressive colonial rule. They were so prized, historically, that folks would embark on dangerous, years'-long sea voyages and desert treks and spend fortunes just to acquire them!</p>

      <p>Yes, I thank my lucky stars that I live in <em>this</em> time. Without an abundance of inexpensive spices, apple pie and pumpkin pie would be sad, homely treats. I wouldn't be able to afford to taste, much less cook, chana masala, Jamaican jerk chicken, Thai green curry, chai spice tea, or gingerbread. And what would become of Scandinavian baking, with its penchant for cardamom and caraway?</p>

      <p>My new favorite Christmas treats, Yotam Ottolengi and Sami Tamimi's spice cookies from their <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Jerusalem-Cookbook-Yotam-Ottolenghi/dp/1607743949" rel="external">Jerusalem cookbook</a>, would be nigh on impossible to make in any other time by anyone except for the wealthiest royalty. The addictive little lumps are full of ingredients that were once exotic: cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, and allspice, not to mention chocolate, orange zest, and lemon zest! And what a shame it would be to miss out on these treats. From the first bite&mdash;cracking through an icing crust of lemon glaze, into a velvety cushion of cocoa and spice studded with little currant jewels&mdash;I was officially smitten. I have hunch you will be, too.</p>

      <p>And this is coming from a woman who, by all accounts, shouldn't love this recipe: I'm not usually a chocolate-with-other-flavors kind of person, and I am frequently frustrated when "spiced" baked goods fall flat from lack of taste. But <em>oh</em> these little tuffets are <em>packed</em> with a multitude of flavors, the combination of which really does work marvelously well.</p>
      <p>Like I said, these are my new favorite Christmas cookies. I do hope you'll make them. Go, revel in their delicious complexity, and appreciate the fact that you live in a time when you're able to make them at all.</p>

      <p class="medium">Ottolenghi's Spice Cookies</p>
      <p>I adapted this recipe from <a href="http://www.thewednesdaychef.com/the_wednesday_chef/2012/12/ottolenghis-spice-cookies.html" rel="external">Luisa's version on The Wednesday Chef</a>, who adapted it from <u>Jerusalem: A Cookbook</u>. The batch makes about 30 small cookies (The original recipe called for 100 gram cookies. I made 50 gram cookies, since I'm bringing them to a cookie exchange.)</p>
      <p><strong>Ingredients for the Cookies:</strong></p>
      <p>
       ¾ cup + 2 tablespoons currants (or combination of currants and minced raisins)<br/>
        2 tablespoons brandy<br/>
        scant two cups / 240 grams all-purpose flour<br/>
        1 ½ teaspoons cocoa powder<br/>
        ½ teaspoon baking powder<br/>
        1/4 teaspoon baking soda<br/>
        ½ teaspoon ground cinnamon<br/>
        ½ teaspoon ground allspice<br/>
        ½ teaspoon ground ginger<br/>
        ½ teaspoon ground nutmeg<br/>
        1/4 teaspoon salt<br/>
        5 ounces / 150 grams good-quality dark chocolate, coarsely grated<br/>
        1/2 cup / 1 stick / 125 grams butter, at room temperature<br/>
        2/3 cup / 135 grams granulated sugar<br/>
        1 teaspoon vanilla extract<br/>
        ½ teaspoon grated lemon zest<br/>
        ½ teaspoon grated orange zest<br/>
        half of a large egg<br/>
        a couple tablespoons of minced crystallized ginger and candied orange peel<br/>
     </p>
     <p>
       <strong>Ingredients for the Lemon Glaze:</strong>
       <br/>
       <em>(Do not skip the lemon glaze! It is essential!)</em>
     </p>
     <p>
       3 tablespoons freshly squeezed lemon juice<br/>
       1 cup powdered sugar<br/>
     </p>
     <p>
       <strong>Instructions:</strong>
     </p>
     <p>Measure the currants into a small bowl and drizzle the brandy over them. While they soak for a bit, begin preparing the rest of your ingredients: in a large bowl, whisk together the flour, cocoa powder, baking powder, baking soda, spices, salt, and dark chocolate. (Pro tip: do not slice your finger open grating chocolate by hand.)</p>
     <p>In a separate bowl, cream the butter, sugar, vanilla, and lemon and orange zest until it's smooth and creamy. Add the half an egg (you can crack it in a bowl, use a fork to mix the white and yolk as you would for scrambled eggs, and pour in half), and mix thoroughly. Add the dry ingredients, and then dump in the currants and brandy. Stir until everything comes together.</p>
     <p>Knead the dough gently with your hands until it becomes a uniform blob.</p>
     <p>Using a kitchen scale, weigh the dough into 50 gram chunks, and roll each one into ball in your palms until it's perfectly round and shiny. Place the balls on a baking sheet (lined with parchment, if yours is prone to sticking), leaving just shy of an inch between them. Pop the dough balls in the fridge to rest. Once they'd chilled, I transferred mine to a ziploc bag and left them in the fridge for three days before baking, but you can bake yours after as little as an hour.</p>
     <p>Preheat the oven to 375°F, and bake the cookies for 12-15 minutes, until they firm up, and some of the balls have cracked open. Take the pan out of the oven. Let the cookies cool for a few minutes on the pan, then transfer them to a wire rack.</p>
     <p>When the cookies are just barely still warm, mix the icing ingredients together until the glaze is smooth. Set the cooling rack over a cookie sheet to catch icing drips. When your tray is ready, pour a little of the glaze over each cookie. I ended up double-coating my cookies to leave a more substantial coating. While the icing is still wet, decorate the top of each cookie with two or three pieces of minced crystallized ginger and candied orange peel.</p>
